# College-Feedback-Classifier
This project classifies student feedback into various themes
#  College Feedback Classifier

This project classifies student feedback into key categories such as Academics, Facilities, and Administration using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and AI models. It helps college administrators understand what students feel about different aspects of the institution.

##  Project Objective

The main goal of this project is to:
- Analyze student feedback automatically
- Classify it into meaningful categories
- Provide quick insights for decision-making and improvement

---

## Technologies & Tools Used

- IBM Watsonx.ai – For deploying and fine-tuning foundation models
- FLAN-T5 / Mistral – Pre-trained language models for text classification
- Python – For backend logic and data handling
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab – For model development and testing
- JSON / CSV – For handling datasets
- GitHub – For version control and sharing

##  How to Use

1. Clone the repository or upload files to your environment.
2. Open `classifier_model.ipynb` in Jupyter or Google Colab.
3. Upload your feedback dataset (CSV format).
4. Run all the cells to classify the feedback.
5. View/download the results from the output section.

##  Sample Categories

-  Academics (e.g., "Teachers are helpful.")
-  Facilities (e.g., "Wi-Fi speed is low.")
-  Administration (e.g., "Fee process is confusing.")

---

##  Features

- Zero manual effort to sort feedback
- Supports multiple categories
- Fast and accurate predictions using foundation models
- Works well on small to medium datasets

---

##  Future Improvements

- Add GUI for uploading feedback
- Support more categories like *Hostel, Transport, Placement
- Use advanced models like Mixtral or Gemini Pro
